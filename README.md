# new-schedule

## Description
   I used JavaScript and HTML to create a basic scheduling tool. The date is displayed at the top, the time is color coded by past, present and future, and text can be input to plan your day ahead. I used localStorage to save the text inputs so when the page is refreshed or revisited, the schedule is the same.
